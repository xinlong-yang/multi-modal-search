Nevertheless, almost all existing studies follow the pipeline to first learn intra-modal features separately and then conduct simple feature concatenation or attention-based feature fusion to generate responses, which hampers them from learning inter-modal interactions and conducting cross-modal feature alignment for generating more intention-aware responses. To address these issues, we propose UniTranSeR, a Unified Transformer Semantic Representation framework with feature alignment and intention reasoning for multimodal dialog systems. Specifically, we first embed the multimodal features into a unified Transformer semantic space to prompt inter-modal interactions, and then devise a feature alignment and intention reasoning (FAIR) layer to perform cross-modal entity alignment and fine-grained key-value reasoning, so as to effectively identify user’s intention for generating more accurate responses. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of UniTranSeR, showing that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the representative MMD dataset."
1,ACL,"Improving Personalized Explanation Generation through Visualization (Geng et al., ACL 2022)","Shijie Geng, Zuohui Fu, Yingqiang Ge, Lei Li, Gerard de Melo, Yongfeng Zhang","In modern recommender systems, there are usually comments or reviews from users that justify their ratings for different items. Trained on such textual corpus, explainable recommendation models learn to discover user interests and generate personalized explanations. Though able to provide plausible explanations, existing models tend to generate repeated sentences for different items or empty sentences with insufficient details. This begs an interesting question: can we immerse the models in a multimodal environment to gain proper awareness of real-world concepts and alleviate above shortcomings? To this end, we propose a visually-enhanced approach named METER with the help of visualization generation and text–image matching discrimination: the explainable recommendation model is encouraged to visualize what it refers to while incurring a penalty if the visualization is incongruent with the textual explanation. Experimental results and a manual assessment demonstrate that our approach can improve not only the text quality but also the diversity and explainability of the generated explanations."
2,ACL,"Hypergraph Transformer: Weakly-Supervised Multi-hop Reasoning for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (Heo et al., ACL 2022)","Yu-Jung Heo, Eun-Sol Kim, Woo Suk Choi, Byoung-Tak Zhang","Knowledge-based visual question answering (QA) aims to answer a question which requires visually-grounded external knowledge beyond image content itself. Answering complex questions that require multi-hop reasoning under weak supervision is considered as a challenging problem since i) no supervision is given to the reasoning process and ii) high-order semantics of multi-hop knowledge facts need to be captured. In this paper, we introduce a concept of hypergraph to encode high-level semantics of a question and a knowledge base, and to learn high-order associations between them. The proposed model, Hypergraph Transformer, constructs a question hypergraph and a query-aware knowledge hypergraph, and infers an answer by encoding inter-associations between two hypergraphs and intra-associations in both hypergraph itself. Extensive experiments on two knowledge-based visual QA and two knowledge-based textual QA demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for multi-hop reasoning problem.

However, they have been shown vulnerable to adversarial attacks especially for logographic languages like Chinese. In this work, we propose RoCBert: a pretrained Chinese Bert that is robust to various forms of adversarial attacks like word perturbation, synonyms, typos, etc. It is pretrained with the contrastive learning objective which maximizes the label consistency under different synthesized adversarial examples. The model takes as input multimodal information including the semantic, phonetic and visual features. We show all these features areimportant to the model robustness since the attack can be performed in all the three forms. Across 5 Chinese NLU tasks, RoCBert outperforms strong baselines under three blackbox adversarial algorithms without sacrificing the performance on clean testset. It also performs the best in the toxic content detection task under human-made attacks."
4,ACL,"Premise-based Multimodal Reasoning: Conditional Inference on Joint Textual and Visual Clues (Dong et al., ACL 2022)","Qingxiu Dong, Ziwei Qin, Heming Xia, Tian Feng, Shoujie Tong, Haoran Meng, Lin Xu, Zhongyu Wei, Weidong Zhan, Baobao Chang, Sujian Li, Tianyu Liu, Zhifang Sui","It is a common practice for recent works in vision language cross-modal reasoning to adopt a binary or multi-choice classification formulation taking as input a set of source image(s) and textual query. In this work, we take a sober look at such an “unconditional” formulation in the sense that no prior knowledge is specified with respect to the source image(s). Inspired by the designs of both visual commonsense reasoning and natural language inference tasks, we propose a new task termed “Premise-based Multi-modal Reasoning” (PMR) where a textual premise is the background presumption on each source image.The PMR dataset contains 15,360 manually annotated samples which are created by a multi-phase crowd-sourcing process. With selected high-quality movie screenshots and human-curated premise templates from 6 pre-defined categories, we ask crowd-source workers to write one true hypothesis and three distractors (4 choices) given the premise and image through a cross-check procedure."
5,ACL,"There’s a Time and Place for Reasoning Beyond the Image (Fu et al., ACL 2022)","Xingyu Fu, Ben Zhou, Ishaan Chandratreya, Carl Vondrick, Dan Roth","Images are often more significant than only the pixels to human eyes, as we can infer, associate, and reason with contextual information from other sources to establish a more complete picture. For example, in Figure 1, we can find a way to identify the news articles related to the picture through segment-wise understandings of the signs, the buildings, the crowds, and more. This reasoning could provide the time and place the image was taken, which will help us in subsequent tasks, such as automatic storyline construction, correction of image source in intended effect photographs, and upper-stream processing such as image clustering for certain location or time.In this work, we formulate this problem and introduce TARA: a dataset with 16k images with their associated news, time, and location, automatically extracted from New York Times, and an additional 61k examples as distant supervision from WIT. On top of the extractions, we present a crowdsourced subset in which we believe it is possible to find the images’ spatio-temporal information for evaluation purpose. We show that there exists a 70% gap between a state-of-the-art joint model and human performance, which is slightly filled by our proposed model that uses segment-wise reasoning, motivating higher-level vision-language joint models that can conduct open-ended reasoning with world knowledge.The data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/zeyofu/TARA."
6,ACL,"Multimodal fusion via cortical network inspired losses (Shankar, ACL 2022)",Shiv Shankar,"Information integration from different modalities is an active area of research. Human beings and, in general, biological neural systems are quite adept at using a multitude of signals from different sensory perceptive fields to interact with the environment and each other. Recent work in deep fusion models via neural networks has led to substantial improvements over unimodal approaches in areas like speech recognition, emotion recognition and analysis, captioning and image description. However, such research has mostly focused on architectural changes allowing for fusion of different modalities while keeping the model complexity manageable.Inspired by neuroscientific ideas about multisensory integration and processing, we investigate the effect of introducing neural dependencies in the loss functions. Experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis tasks with different models show that our approach provides a consistent performance boost."
7,ACL,"Modeling Temporal-Modal Entity Graph for Procedural Multimodal Machine Comprehension (Zhang et al., ACL 2022)","Huibin Zhang, Zhengkun Zhang, Yao Zhang, Jun Wang, Yufan Li, Ning Jiang, Xin Wei, Zhenglu Yang","Procedural Multimodal Documents (PMDs) organize textual instructions and corresponding images step by step. Comprehending PMDs and inducing their representations for the downstream reasoning tasks is designated as Procedural MultiModal Machine Comprehension (M3C). In this study, we approach Procedural M3C at a fine-grained level (compared with existing explorations at a document or sentence level), that is, entity. With delicate consideration, we model entity both in its temporal and cross-modal relation and propose a novel Temporal-Modal Entity Graph (TMEG). Specifically, graph structure is formulated to capture textual and visual entities and trace their temporal-modal evolution. In addition, a graph aggregation module is introduced to conduct graph encoding and reasoning. Comprehensive experiments across three Procedural M3C tasks are conducted on a traditional dataset RecipeQA and our new dataset CraftQA, which can better evaluate the generalization of TMEG."
8,ACL,"Unified Speech-Text Pre-training for Speech Translation and Recognition (Tang et al., ACL 2022)","Yun Tang, Hongyu Gong, Ning Dong, Changhan Wang, Wei-Ning Hsu, Jiatao Gu, Alexei Baevski, Xian Li, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Michael Auli, Juan Pino","In this work, we describe a method to jointly pre-train speech and text in an encoder-decoder modeling framework for speech translation and recognition. The proposed method utilizes multi-task learning to integrate four self-supervised and supervised subtasks for cross modality learning. A self-supervised speech subtask, which leverages unlabelled speech data, and a (self-)supervised text to text subtask, which makes use of abundant text training data, take up the majority of the pre-training time. Two auxiliary supervised speech tasks are included to unify speech and text modeling space. Detailed analysis reveals learning interference among subtasks. In order to alleviate the subtask interference, two pre-training configurations are proposed for speech translation and speech recognition respectively. Our experiments show the proposed method can effectively fuse speech and text information into one model. It achieves between 1.7 and 2.3 BLEU improvement above the state of the art on the MuST-C speech translation dataset and comparable WERs to wav2vec 2.0 on the Librispeech speech recognition task."
9,ACL,"Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection via Cross-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (Liang et al., ACL 2022)","Bin Liang, Chenwei Lou, Xiang Li, Min Yang, Lin Gui, Yulan He, Wenjie Pei, Ruifeng Xu","With the increasing popularity of posting multimodal messages online, many recent studies have been carried out utilizing both textual and visual information for multi-modal sarcasm detection. In this paper, we investigate multi-modal sarcasm detection from a novel perspective by constructing a cross-modal graph for each instance to explicitly draw the ironic relations between textual and visual modalities. Specifically, we first detect the objects paired with descriptions of the image modality, enabling the learning of important visual information. Then, the descriptions of the objects are served as a bridge to determine the importance of the association between the objects of image modality and the contextual words of text modality, so as to build a cross-modal graph for each multi-modal instance. Furthermore, we devise a cross-modal graph convolutional network to make sense of the incongruity relations between modalities for multi-modal sarcasm detection. Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal sarcasm detection."
10,ACL,"OpenHands: Making Sign Language Recognition Accessible with Pose-based Pretrained Models across Languages (Selvaraj et al., ACL 2022)","Prem Selvaraj, Gokul Nc, Pratyush Kumar, Mitesh Khapra","AI technologies for Natural Languages have made tremendous progress recently. However, commensurate progress has not been made on Sign Languages, in particular, in recognizing signs as individual words or as complete sentences. We introduce OpenHands, a library where we take four key ideas from the NLP community for low-resource languages and apply them to sign languages for word-level recognition. First, we propose using pose extracted through pretrained models as the standard modality of data in this work to reduce training time and enable efficient inference, and we release standardized pose datasets for different existing sign language datasets. Second, we train and release checkpoints of 4 pose-based isolated sign language recognition models across 6 languages (American, Argentinian, Chinese, Greek, Indian, and Turkish), providing baselines and ready checkpoints for deployment. Third, to address the lack of labelled data, we propose self-supervised pretraining on unlabelled data. We curate and release the largest pose-based pretraining dataset on Indian Sign Language (Indian-SL). Fourth, we compare different pretraining strategies and for the first time establish that pretraining is effective for sign language recognition by demonstrating (a) improved fine-tuning performance especially in low-resource settings, and (b) high crosslingual transfer from Indian-SL to few other sign languages. We open-source all models and datasets in OpenHands with a hope that it makes research in sign languages reproducible and more accessible."
11,ACL,"Vision-Language Pre-Training for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (Ling et al., ACL 2022)","Yan Ling, Jianfei Yu, Rui Xia","As an important task in sentiment analysis, Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) has attracted increasing attention inrecent years. However, previous approaches either (i) use separately pre-trained visual and textual models, which ignore the crossmodalalignment or (ii) use vision-language models pre-trained with general pre-training tasks, which are inadequate to identify fine-grainedaspects, opinions, and their alignments across modalities. To tackle these limitations, we propose a task-specific Vision-LanguagePre-training framework for MABSA (VLP-MABSA), which is a unified multimodal encoder-decoder architecture for all the pretrainingand downstream tasks. We further design three types of task-specific pre-training tasks from the language, vision, and multimodalmodalities, respectively. Experimental results show that our approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on three MABSA subtasks. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of each pre-training task. The source code is publicly released at https://github.com/NUSTM/VLP-MABSA."
12,ACL,"“You might think about slightly revising the title”: Identifying Hedges in Peer-tutoring Interactions (Raphalen et al., ACL 2022)","Yann Raphalen, Chloé Clavel, Justine Cassell","Hedges have an important role in the management of rapport. In peer-tutoring, they are notably used by tutors in dyads experiencing low rapport to tone down the impact of instructions and negative feedback.Pursuing the objective of building a tutoring agent that manages rapport with teenagers in order to improve learning, we used a multimodal peer-tutoring dataset to construct a computational framework for identifying hedges. We compared approaches relying on pre-trained resources with others that integrate insights from the social science literature. Our best performance involved a hybrid approach that outperforms the existing baseline while being easier to interpret. We employ a model explainability tool to explore the features that characterize hedges in peer-tutoring conversations, and we identify some novel features, and the benefits of a such a hybrid model approach."
13,ACL,"Things not Written in Text: Exploring Spatial Commonsense from Visual Signals (Liu et al., ACL 2022)","Xiao Liu, Da Yin, Yansong Feng, Dongyan Zhao","Spatial commonsense, the knowledge about spatial position and relationship between objects (like the relative size of a lion and a girl, and the position of a boy relative to a bicycle when cycling), is an important part of commonsense knowledge. Although pretrained language models (PLMs) succeed in many NLP tasks, they are shown to be ineffective in spatial commonsense reasoning. Starting from the observation that images are more likely to exhibit spatial commonsense than texts, we explore whether models with visual signals learn more spatial commonsense than text-based PLMs. We propose a spatial commonsense benchmark that focuses on the relative scales of objects, and the positional relationship between people and objects under different actions.We probe PLMs and models with visual signals, including vision-language pretrained models and image synthesis models, on this benchmark, and find that image synthesis models are more capable of learning accurate and consistent spatial knowledge than other models. The spatial knowledge from image synthesis models also helps in natural language understanding tasks that require spatial commonsense."
14,ACL,"MSCTD: A Multimodal Sentiment Chat Translation Dataset (Liang et al., ACL 2022)","Yunlong Liang, Fandong Meng, Jinan Xu, Yufeng Chen, Jie Zhou","Multimodal machine translation and textual chat translation have received considerable attention in recent years. Although the conversation in its natural form is usually multimodal, there still lacks work on multimodal machine translation in conversations. In this work, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Chat Translation (MCT), aiming to generate more accurate translations with the help of the associated dialogue history and visual context. To this end, we firstly construct a Multimodal Sentiment Chat Translation Dataset (MSCTD) containing 142,871 English-Chinese utterance pairs in 14,762 bilingual dialogues. Each utterance pair, corresponding to the visual context that reflects the current conversational scene, is annotated with a sentiment label. Then, we benchmark the task by establishing multiple baseline systems that incorporate multimodal and sentiment features for MCT. Preliminary experiments on two language directions (English-Chinese) verify the potential of contextual and multimodal information fusion and the positive impact of sentiment on the MCT task. Additionally, we provide a new benchmark on multimodal dialogue sentiment analysis with the constructed MSCTD. Our work can facilitate researches on both multimodal chat translation and multimodal dialogue sentiment analysis."
15,ACL,"Leveraging Visual Knowledge in Language Tasks: An Empirical Study on Intermediate Pre-training for Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer (Jin et al., ACL 2022)","Woojeong Jin, Dong-Ho Lee, Chenguang Zhu, Jay Pujara, Xiang Ren","Pre-trained language models are still far from human performance in tasks that need understanding of properties (e.g. appearance, measurable quantity) and affordances of everyday objects in the real world since the text lacks such information due to reporting bias.In this work, we study whether integrating visual knowledge into a language model can fill the gap.We investigate two types of knowledge transfer: (1) text knowledge transfer using image captions that may contain enriched visual knowledge and (2) cross-modal knowledge transfer using both images and captions with vision-language training objectives.On 5 downstream tasks that may need visual knowledge to solve the problem, we perform extensive empirical comparisons over the presented objectives.Our experiments show that visual knowledge transfer can improve performance in both low-resource and fully supervised settings."
16,ACL,"A Good Prompt Is Worth Millions of Parameters: Low-resource Prompt-based Learning for Vision-Language Models (Jin et al., ACL 2022)","Woojeong Jin, Yu Cheng, Yelong Shen, Weizhu Chen, Xiang Ren","Large pre-trained vision-language (VL) models can learn a new task with a handful of examples and generalize to a new task without fine-tuning.However, these VL models are hard to deploy for real-world applications due to their impractically huge sizes and slow inference speed.To solve this limitation, we study prompt-based low-resource learning of VL tasks with our proposed method, FewVLM, relatively smaller than recent few-shot learners.For FewVLM, we pre-train a sequence-to-sequence transformer model with prefix language modeling (PrefixLM) and masked language modeling (MaskedLM).Furthermore, we analyze the effect of diverse prompts for few-shot tasks.Experimental results on VQA show that FewVLM with prompt-based learning outperforms Frozen which is 31x larger than FewVLM by 18.2% point and achieves comparable results to a 246x larger model, PICa.In our analysis, we observe that (1) prompts significantly affect zero-shot performance but marginally affect few-shot performance, (2) models with noisy prompts learn as quickly as hand-crafted prompts given larger training data, and (3) MaskedLM helps VQA tasks while PrefixLM boosts captioning performance.

17,ACL,"Multimodal Dialogue Response Generation (Sun et al., ACL 2022)","Qingfeng Sun, Yujing Wang, Can Xu, Kai Zheng, Yaming Yang, Huang Hu, Fei Xu, Jessica Zhang, Xiubo Geng, Daxin Jiang","Responsing with image has been recognized as an important capability for an intelligent conversational agent. Yet existing works only focus on exploring the multimodal dialogue models which depend on retrieval-based methods, but neglecting generation methods. To fill in the gaps, we first present a new task: multimodal dialogue response generation (MDRG) - given the dialogue history, one model needs to generate a text sequence or an image as response. Learning such a MDRG model often requires multimodal dialogues containing both texts and images which are difficult to obtain. Motivated by the challenge in practice, we consider MDRG under a natural assumption that only limited training examples are available. In such a low-resource setting, we devise a novel conversational agent, Divter, in order to isolate parameters that depend on multimodal dialogues from the entire generation model. By this means, the major part of the model can be learned from a large number of text-only dialogues and text-image pairs respectively, then the whole parameters can be well fitted using the limited training examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluation, and can generate informative text and high-resolution image responses."
18,ACL,"Cross-Modal Discrete Representation Learning (Liu et al., ACL 2022)","Alexander Liu, SouYoung Jin, Cheng-I Lai, Andrew Rouditchenko, Aude Oliva, James Glass","In contrast to recent advances focusing on high-level representation learning across modalities, in this work we present a self-supervised learning framework that is able to learn a representation that captures finer levels of granularity across different modalities such as concepts or events represented by visual objects or spoken words. Our framework relies on a discretized embedding space created via vector quantization that is shared across different modalities. Beyond the shared embedding space, we propose a Cross-Modal Code Matching objective that forces the representations from different views (modalities) to have a similar distribution over the discrete embedding space such that cross-modal objects/actions localization can be performed without direct supervision. We show that the proposed discretized multi-modal fine-grained representation (e.g., pixel/word/frame) can complement high-level summary representations (e.g., video/sentence/waveform) for improved performance on cross-modal retrieval tasks. We also observe that the discretized representation uses individual clusters to represent the same semantic concept across modalities."
19,ACL,"Contrastive Visual Semantic Pretraining Magnifies the Semantics of Natural Language Representations (Wolfe & Caliskan, ACL 2022)","Robert Wolfe, Aylin Caliskan","We examine the effects of contrastive visual semantic pretraining by comparing the geometry and semantic properties of contextualized English language representations formed by GPT-2 and CLIP, a zero-shot multimodal image classifier which adapts the GPT-2 architecture to encode image captions. We find that contrastive visual semantic pretraining significantly mitigates the anisotropy found in contextualized word embeddings from GPT-2, such that the intra-layer self-similarity (mean pairwise cosine similarity) of CLIP word embeddings is under .25 in all layers, compared to greater than .95 in the top layer of GPT-2. CLIP word embeddings outperform GPT-2 on word-level semantic intrinsic evaluation tasks, and achieve a new corpus-based state of the art for the RG65 evaluation, at .88. CLIP also forms fine-grained semantic representations of sentences, and obtains Spearman’s 𝜌 = .73 on the SemEval-2017 Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark with no fine-tuning, compared to no greater than 𝜌 = .45 in any layer of GPT-2. Finally, intra-layer self-similarity of CLIP sentence embeddings decreases as the layer index increases, finishing at .25 in the top layer, while the self-similarity of GPT-2 sentence embeddings formed using the EOS token increases layer-over-layer and never falls below .97. Our results indicate that high anisotropy is not an inevitable consequence of contextualization, and that visual semantic pretraining is beneficial not only for ordering visual representations, but also for encoding useful semantic representations of language, both on the word level and the sentence level."
20,ACL,"Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation With Discrete Units (Lee et al., ACL 2022)","Ann Lee, Peng-Jen Chen, Changhan Wang, Jiatao Gu, Sravya Popuri, Xutai Ma, Adam Polyak, Yossi Adi, Qing He, Yun Tang, Juan Pino, Wei-Ning Hsu","We present a direct speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) model that translates speech from one language to speech in another language without relying on intermediate text generation. We tackle the problem by first applying a self-supervised discrete speech encoder on the target speech and then training a sequence-to-sequence speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) model to predict the discrete representations of the target speech. When target text transcripts are available, we design a joint speech and text training framework that enables the model to generate dual modality output (speech and text) simultaneously in the same inference pass. Experiments on the Fisher Spanish-English dataset show that the proposed framework yields improvement of 6.7 BLEU compared with a baseline direct S2ST model that predicts spectrogram features. When trained without any text transcripts, our model performance is comparable to models that predict spectrograms and are trained with text supervision, showing the potential of our system for translation between unwritten languages."
21,ACL,"Image Retrieval from Contextual Descriptions (Krojer et al., ACL 2022)","Benno Krojer, Vaibhav Adlakha, Vibhav Vineet, Yash Goyal, Edoardo Ponti, Siva Reddy","The ability to integrate context, including perceptual and temporal cues, plays a pivotal role in grounding the meaning of a linguistic utterance. In order to measure to what extent current vision-and-language models master this ability, we devise a new multimodal challenge, Image Retrieval from Contextual Descriptions (ImageCoDe). In particular, models are tasked with retrieving the correct image from a set of 10 minimally contrastive candidates based on a contextual description.As such, each description contains only the details that help distinguish between images.Because of this, descriptions tend to be complex in terms of syntax and discourse and require drawing pragmatic inferences. Images are sourced from both static pictures and video frames.We benchmark several state-of-the-art models, including both cross-encoders such as ViLBERT and bi-encoders such as CLIP, on ImageCoDe.Our results reveal that these models dramatically lag behind human performance: the best variant achieves an accuracy of 20.9 on video frames and 59.4 on static pictures, compared with 90.8 in humans.Furthermore, we experiment with new model variants that are better equipped to incorporate visual and temporal context into their representations, which achieve modest gains. Our hope is that ImageCoDE will foster progress in grounded language understanding by encouraging models to focus on fine-grained visual differences."
22,ACL,"Incorporating Stock Market Signals for Twitter Stance Detection (Conforti et al., ACL 2022)","Costanza Conforti, Jakob Berndt, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar, Chryssi Giannitsarou, Flavio Toxvaerd, Nigel Collier","Research in stance detection has so far focused on models which leverage purely textual input. In this paper, we investigate the integration of textual and financial signals for stance detection in the financial domain. Specifically, we propose a robust multi-task neural architecture that combines textual input with high-frequency intra-day time series from stock market prices. Moreover, we extend wt–wt, an existing stance detection dataset which collects tweets discussing Mergers and Acquisitions operations, with the relevant financial signal. Importantly, the obtained dataset aligns with Stander, an existing news stance detection dataset, thus resulting in a unique multimodal, multi-genre stance detection resource. We show experimentally and through detailed result analysis that our stance detection system benefits from financial information, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the wt–wt dataset: this demonstrates that the combination of multiple input signals is effective for cross-target stance detection, and opens interesting research directions for future work."
23,ACL,"MMCoQA: Conversational Question Answering over Text, Tables, and Images (Li et al., ACL 2022)","Yongqi Li, Wenjie Li, Liqiang Nie","The rapid development of conversational assistants accelerates the study on conversational question answering (QA). However, the existing conversational QA systems usually answer users’ questions with a single knowledge source, e.g., paragraphs or a knowledge graph, but overlook the important visual cues, let alone multiple knowledge sources of different modalities. In this paper, we hence define a novel research task, i.e., multimodal conversational question answering (MMCoQA), aiming to answer users’ questions with multimodal knowledge sources via multi-turn conversations. This new task brings a series of research challenges, including but not limited to priority, consistency, and complementarity of multimodal knowledge. To facilitate the data-driven approaches in this area, we construct the first multimodal conversational QA dataset, named MMConvQA. Questions are fully annotated with not only natural language answers but also the corresponding evidence and valuable decontextualized self-contained questions. Meanwhile, we introduce an end-to-end baseline model, which divides this complex research task into question understanding, multi-modal evidence retrieval, and answer extraction. Moreover, we report a set of benchmarking results, and the results indicate that there is ample room for improvement."
24,ACL,"Leveraging Unimodal Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (Pan et al., ACL 2022)","Xichen Pan, Peiyu Chen, Yichen Gong, Helong Zhou, Xinbing Wang, Zhouhan Lin","Training Transformer-based models demands a large amount of data, while obtaining aligned and labelled data in multimodality is rather cost-demanding, especially for audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR). Thus it makes a lot of sense to make use of unlabelled unimodal data. On the other side, although the effectiveness of large-scale self-supervised learning is well established in both audio and visual modalities, how to integrate those pre-trained models into a multimodal scenario remains underexplored. In this work, we successfully leverage unimodal self-supervised learning to promote the multimodal AVSR. In particular, audio and visual front-ends are trained on large-scale unimodal datasets, then we integrate components of both front-ends into a larger multimodal framework which learns to recognize parallel audio-visual data into characters through a combination of CTC and seq2seq decoding. We show that both components inherited from unimodal self-supervised learning cooperate well, resulting in that the multimodal framework yields competitive results through fine-tuning. Our model is experimentally validated on both word-level and sentence-level tasks. Especially, even without an external language model, our proposed model raises the state-of-the-art performances on the widely accepted Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) dataset by a large margin, with a relative improvement of 30%."
25,ACL,"Understanding Multimodal Procedural Knowledge by Sequencing Multimodal Instructional Manuals (Wu et al., ACL 2022)","Te-Lin Wu, Alex Spangher, Pegah Alipoormolabashi, Marjorie Freedman, Ralph Weischedel, Nanyun Peng","The ability to sequence unordered events is evidence of comprehension and reasoning about real world tasks/procedures. It is essential for applications such as task planning and multi-source instruction summarization.It often requires thorough understanding of temporal common sense and multimodal information, since these procedures are often conveyed by a combination of texts and images.While humans are capable of reasoning about and sequencing unordered procedural instructions, the extent to which the current machine learning methods possess such capability is still an open question.In this work, we benchmark models’ capability of reasoning over and sequencing unordered multimodal instructions by curating datasets from online instructional manuals and collecting comprehensive human annotations.We find current state-of-the-art models not only perform significantly worse than humans but also seem incapable of efficiently utilizing multimodal information.To improve machines’ performance on multimodal event sequencing, we propose sequence-aware pretraining techniques exploiting the sequential alignment properties of both texts and images, resulting in > 5% improvements on perfect match ratio."
26,ACL,"WikiDiverse: A Multimodal Entity Linking Dataset with Diversified Contextual Topics and Entity Types (Wang et al., ACL 2022)","Xuwu Wang, Junfeng Tian, Min Gui, Zhixu Li, Rui Wang, Ming Yan, Lihan Chen, Yanghua Xiao","Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) which aims at linking mentions with multimodal contexts to the referent entities from a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia), is an essential task for many multimodal applications. Although much attention has been paid to MEL, the shortcomings of existing MEL datasets including limited contextual topics and entity types, simplified mention ambiguity, and restricted availability, have caused great obstacles to the research and application of MEL. In this paper, we present WikiDiverse, a high-quality human-annotated MEL dataset with diversified contextual topics and entity types from Wikinews, which uses Wikipedia as the corresponding knowledge base. A well-tailored annotation procedure is adopted to ensure the quality of the dataset. Based on WikiDiverse, a sequence of well-designed MEL models with intra-modality and inter-modality attentions are implemented, which utilize the visual information of images more adequately than existing MEL models do. Extensive experimental analyses are conducted to investigate the contributions of different modalities in terms of MEL, facilitating the future research on this task."
27,ACL,"Visual-Language Navigation Pretraining via Prompt-based Environmental Self-exploration (Liang et al., ACL 2022)","Xiwen Liang, Fengda Zhu, Li Lingling, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang","Vision-language navigation (VLN) is a challenging task due to its large searching space in the environment. To address this problem, previous works have proposed some methods of fine-tuning a large model that pretrained on large-scale datasets. However, the conventional fine-tuning methods require extra human-labeled navigation data and lack self-exploration capabilities in environments, which hinders their generalization of unseen scenes. To improve the ability of fast cross-domain adaptation, we propose Prompt-based Environmental Self-exploration (ProbES), which can self-explore the environments by sampling trajectories and automatically generates structured instructions via a large-scale cross-modal pretrained model (CLIP). Our method fully utilizes the knowledge learned from CLIP to build an in-domain dataset by self-exploration without human labeling. Unlike the conventional approach of fine-tuning, we introduce prompt tuning to achieve fast adaptation for language embeddings, which substantially improves the learning efficiency by leveraging prior knowledge. By automatically synthesizing trajectory-instruction pairs in any environment without human supervision and instruction prompt tuning, our model can adapt to diverse vision-language navigation tasks, including VLN and REVERIE. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that our ProbES significantly improves the generalization ability of the navigation model."

However, many advances in language model pre-training are focused on text, a fact that only increases systematic inequalities in the performance of NLP tasks across the world’s languages. In this work, we propose a multi-modal approach to train language models using whatever text and/or audio data might be available in a language. Initial experiments using Swahili and Kinyarwanda data suggest the viability of the approach for downstream Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, with models pre-trained on phone data showing an improvement of up to 6% F1-score above models that are trained from scratch. Preprocessing and training code will be uploaded to https://github.com/sil-ai/phone-it-in."

More specifically, we probe their capabilities of storing the grammatical structure of linguistic data and the structure learned over objects in visual data. To reach that goal, we first make the inherent structure of language and visuals explicit by a dependency parse of the sentences that describe the image and by the dependencies between the object regions in the image, respectively. We call this explicit visual structure the scene tree, that is based on the dependency tree of the language description. Extensive probing experiments show that the multimodal-BERT models do not encode these scene trees."
30,ACL,"Neural Machine Translation with Phrase-Level Universal Visual Representations (Fang & Feng, ACL 2022)","Qingkai Fang, Yang Feng","Multimodal machine translation (MMT) aims to improve neural machine translation (NMT) with additional visual information, but most existing MMT methods require paired input of source sentence and image, which makes them suffer from shortage of sentence-image pairs. In this paper, we propose a phrase-level retrieval-based method for MMT to get visual information for the source input from existing sentence-image data sets so that MMT can break the limitation of paired sentence-image input. Our method performs retrieval at the phrase level and hence learns visual information from pairs of source phrase and grounded region, which can mitigate data sparsity. Furthermore, our method employs the conditional variational auto-encoder to learn visual representations which can filter redundant visual information and only retain visual information related to the phrase. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms strong baselines on multiple MMT datasets, especially when the textual context is limited."

The currently available data resources to support such multimodal affective analysis in dialogues are however limited in scale and diversity. In this work, we propose a Multi-modal Multi-scene Multi-label Emotional Dialogue dataset, M3ED, which contains 990 dyadic emotional dialogues from 56 different TV series, a total of 9,082 turns and 24,449 utterances. M3ED is annotated with 7 emotion categories (happy, surprise, sad, disgust, anger, fear, and neutral) at utterance level, and encompasses acoustic, visual, and textual modalities. To the best of our knowledge, M3ED is the first multimodal emotional dialogue dataset in Chinese.It is valuable for cross-culture emotion analysis and recognition. We apply several state-of-the-art methods on the M3ED dataset to verify the validity and quality of the dataset. We also propose a general Multimodal Dialogue-aware Interaction framework, MDI, to model the dialogue context for emotion recognition, which achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on the M3ED. The full dataset and codes are available."

The SpeechT5 framework consists of a shared encoder-decoder network and six modal-specific (speech/text) pre/post-nets. After preprocessing the input speech/text through the pre-nets, the shared encoder-decoder network models the sequence-to-sequence transformation, and then the post-nets generate the output in the speech/text modality based on the output of the decoder. Leveraging large-scale unlabeled speech and text data, we pre-train SpeechT5 to learn a unified-modal representation, hoping to improve the modeling capability for both speech and text. To align the textual and speech information into this unified semantic space, we propose a cross-modal vector quantization approach that randomly mixes up speech/text states with latent units as the interface between encoder and decoder. Extensive evaluations show the superiority of the proposed SpeechT5 framework on a wide variety of spoken language processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, voice conversion, speech enhancement, and speaker identification."

Sarcasm Explanation in Multi-modal Multi-party Dialogues (Kumar et al., ACL 2022)","Shivani Kumar, Atharva Kulkarni, Md Shad Akhtar, Tanmoy Chakraborty","Indirect speech such as sarcasm achieves a constellation of discourse goals in human communication. While the indirectness of figurative language warrants speakers to achieve certain pragmatic goals, it is challenging for AI agents to comprehend such idiosyncrasies of human communication. Though sarcasm identification has been a well-explored topic in dialogue analysis, for conversational systems to truly grasp a conversation’s innate meaning and generate appropriate responses, simply detecting sarcasm is not enough; it is vital to explain its underlying sarcastic connotation to capture its true essence. In this work, we study the discourse structure of sarcastic conversations and propose a novel task – Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED). Set in a multimodal and code-mixed setting, the task aims to generate natural language explanations of satirical conversations. To this end, we curate WITS, a new dataset to support our task. We propose MAF (Modality Aware Fusion), a multimodal context-aware attention and global information fusion module to capture multimodality and use it to benchmark WITS. The proposed attention module surpasses the traditional multimodal fusion baselines and reports the best performance on almost all metrics. Lastly, we carry out detailed analysis both quantitatively and qualitatively."

While, there are still a large number of digital documents where the layout information is not fixed and needs to be interactively and dynamically rendered for visualization, making existing layout-based pre-training approaches not easy to apply. In this paper, we propose MarkupLM for document understanding tasks with markup languages as the backbone, such as HTML/XML-based documents, where text and markup information is jointly pre-trained. Experiment results show that the pre-trained MarkupLM significantly outperforms the existing strong baseline models on several document understanding tasks. The pre-trained model and code will be publicly available at https://aka.ms/markuplm."

Previously, CLIP is only regarded as a powerful visual encoder. However, after being pre-trained by language supervision from a large amount of image-caption pairs, CLIP itself should also have acquired some few-shot abilities for vision-language tasks. In this work, we empirically show that CLIP can be a strong vision-language few-shot learner by leveraging the power of language. We first evaluate CLIP’s zero-shot performance on a typical visual question answering task and demonstrate a zero-shot cross-modality transfer capability of CLIP on the visual entailment task. Then we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy to boost the few-shot performance on the vqa task. We achieve competitive zero/few-shot results on the visual question answering and visual entailment tasks without introducing any additional pre-training procedure."
36,ACL,"Guided Attention Multimodal Multitask Financial Forecasting with Inter-Company Relationships and Global and Local News (Ang & Lim, ACL 2022)","Gary Ang, Ee-Peng Lim","Most works on financial forecasting use information directly associated with individual companies (e.g., stock prices, news on the company) to predict stock returns for trading. We refer to such company-specific information as local information. Stock returns may also be influenced by global information (e.g., news on the economy in general), and inter-company relationships. Capturing such diverse information is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratios, different time-scales, sparsity and distributions of global and local information from different modalities. In this paper, we propose a model that captures both global and local multimodal information for investment and risk management-related forecasting tasks. Our proposed Guided Attention Multimodal Multitask Network (GAME) model addresses these challenges by using novel attention modules to guide learning with global and local information from different modalities and dynamic inter-company relationship networks. Our extensive experiments show that GAME outperforms other state-of-the-art models in several forecasting tasks and important real-world application case studies."

In this work, we investigate the impact of vision models on MMT. Given the fact that Transformer is becoming popular in computer vision, we experiment with various strong models (such as Vision Transformer) and enhanced features (such as object-detection and image captioning). We develop a selective attention model to study the patch-level contribution of an image in MMT. On detailed probing tasks, we find that stronger vision models are helpful for learning translation from the visual modality. Our results also suggest the need of carefully examining MMT models, especially when current benchmarks are small-scale and biased."

Jimenez, Olga Russakovsky, Karthik Narasimhan","We introduce CARETS, a systematic test suite to measure consistency and robustness of modern VQA models through a series of six fine-grained capability tests. In contrast to existing VQA test sets, CARETS features balanced question generation to create pairs of instances to test models, with each pair focusing on a specific capability such as rephrasing, logical symmetry or image obfuscation. We evaluate six modern VQA systems on CARETS and identify several actionable weaknesses in model comprehension, especially with concepts such as negation, disjunction, or hypernym invariance. Interestingly, even the most sophisticated models are sensitive to aspects such as swapping the order of terms in a conjunction or varying the number of answer choices mentioned in the question. We release CARETS to be used as an extensible tool for evaluating multi-modal model robustness."

Existing techniques often attempt to transfer powerful machine translation (MT) capabilities to ST, but neglect the representation discrepancy across modalities. In this paper, we propose the Speech-TExt Manifold Mixup (STEMM) method to calibrate such discrepancy. Specifically, we mix up the representation sequences of different modalities, and take both unimodal speech sequences and multimodal mixed sequences as input to the translation model in parallel, and regularize their output predictions with a self-learning framework. Experiments on MuST-C speech translation benchmark and further analysis show that our method effectively alleviates the cross-modal representation discrepancy, and achieves significant improvements over a strong baseline on eight translation directions."

To support both code-related understanding and generation tasks, recent works attempt to pre-train unified encoder-decoder models. However, such encoder-decoder framework is sub-optimal for auto-regressive tasks, especially code completion that requires a decoder-only manner for efficient inference. In this paper, we present UniXcoder, a unified cross-modal pre-trained model for programming language. The model utilizes mask attention matrices with prefix adapters to control the behavior of the model and leverages cross-modal contents like AST and code comment to enhance code representation. To encode AST that is represented as a tree in parallel, we propose a one-to-one mapping method to transform AST in a sequence structure that retains all structural information from the tree. Furthermore, we propose to utilize multi-modal contents to learn representation of code fragment with contrastive learning, and then align representations among programming languages using a cross-modal generation task. We evaluate UniXcoder on five code-related tasks over nine datasets. To further evaluate the performance of code fragment representation, we also construct a dataset for a new task, called zero-shot code-to-code search. Results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and analysis reveals that comment and AST can both enhance UniXcoder."

Sarcasm Target Identification (STI) deserves further study to understand sarcasm in depth. However, text lacking context or missing sarcasm target makes target identification very difficult. In this paper, we introduce multimodality to STI and present Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) task. We propose a novel multi-scale cross-modality model that can simultaneously perform textual target labeling and visual target detection. In the model, we extract multi-scale visual features to enrich spatial information for different sized visual sarcasm targets. We design a set of convolution networks to unify multi-scale visual features with textual features for cross-modal attention learning, and correspondingly a set of transposed convolution networks to restore multi-scale visual information. The results show that visual clues can improve the performance of TSTI by a large margin, and VSTI achieves good accuracy."
42,ACL,"Revisiting Over-Smoothness in Text to Speech (Ren et al., ACL 2022)","Yi Ren, Xu Tan, Tao Qin, Zhou Zhao, Tie-Yan Liu","Non-autoregressive text to speech (NAR-TTS) models have attracted much attention from both academia and industry due to their fast generation speed. One limitation of NAR-TTS models is that they ignore the correlation in time and frequency domains while generating speech mel-spectrograms, and thus cause blurry and over-smoothed results. In this work, we revisit this over-smoothing problem from a novel perspective: the degree of over-smoothness is determined by the gap between the complexity of data distributions and the capability of modeling methods. Both simplifying data distributions and improving modeling methods can alleviate the problem. Accordingly, we first study methods reducing the complexity of data distributions. Then we conduct a comprehensive study on NAR-TTS models that use some advanced modeling methods. Based on these studies, we find that 1) methods that provide additional condition inputs reduce the complexity of data distributions to model, thus alleviating the over-smoothing problem and achieving better voice quality. 2) Among advanced modeling methods, Laplacian mixture loss performs well at modeling multimodal distributions and enjoys its simplicity, while GAN and Glow achieve the best voice quality while suffering from increased training or model complexity. 3) The two categories of methods can be combined to further alleviate the over-smoothness and improve the voice quality. 4) Our experiments on the multi-speaker dataset lead to similar conclusions as above and providing more variance information can reduce the difficulty of modeling the target data distribution and alleviate the requirements for model capacity."

VALSE offers a suite of six tests covering various linguistic constructs. Solving these requires models to ground linguistic phenomena in the visual modality, allowing more fine-grained evaluations than hitherto possible. We build VALSE using methods that support the construction of valid foils, and report results from evaluating five widely-used V&L models. Our experiments suggest that current models have considerable difficulty addressing most phenomena. Hence, we expect VALSE to serve as an important benchmark to measure future progress of pretrained V&L models from a linguistic perspective, complementing the canonical task-centred V&L evaluations."

Although many advanced techniques are proposed to improve its generation quality, they still need the help of an autoregressive model for training to overcome the one-to-many multi-modal phenomenon in the dataset, limiting their applications. In this paper, we propose GLAT, which employs the discrete latent variables to capture word categorical information and invoke an advanced curriculum learning technique, alleviating the multi-modality problem. Experiment results show that our method outperforms strong baselines without the help of an autoregressive model, which further broadens the application scenarios of the parallel decoding paradigm."
45,ACL,"Improving Machine Reading Comprehension with Contextualized Commonsense Knowledge (Sun et al., ACL 2022)","Kai Sun, Dian Yu, Jianshu Chen, Dong Yu, Claire Cardie","To perform well on a machine reading comprehension (MRC) task, machine readers usually require commonsense knowledge that is not explicitly mentioned in the given documents. This paper aims to extract a new kind of structured knowledge from scripts and use it to improve MRC. We focus on scripts as they contain rich verbal and nonverbal messages, and two relevant messages originally conveyed by different modalities during a short time period may serve as arguments of a piece of commonsense knowledge as they function together in daily communications. To save human efforts to name relations, we propose to represent relations implicitly by situating such an argument pair in a context and call it contextualized knowledge. To use the extracted knowledge to improve MRC, we compare several fine-tuning strategies to use the weakly-labeled MRC data constructed based on contextualized knowledge and further design a teacher-student paradigm with multiple teachers to facilitate the transfer of knowledge in weakly-labeled MRC data. Experimental results show that our paradigm outperforms other methods that use weakly-labeled data and improves a state-of-the-art baseline by 4.3% in accuracy on a Chinese multiple-choice MRC dataset C3, wherein most of the questions require unstated prior knowledge. We also seek to transfer the knowledge to other tasks by simply adapting the resulting student reader, yielding a 2.9% improvement in F1 on a relation extraction dataset DialogRE, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the knowledge for non-MRC tasks that require document comprehension."
